Have you ever wished for the perfect excuse to bail during a bad date?

No worries - we've all been there. And we have a solution: the Bad Date Buzzer! A small, compact device, you can hide the Bad Date Buzzer discreetly in a purse or bag and bring it with you on a date and never have to worry about sitting through an hour of mediocre spaghetti and even more mediocre conversation. Once your date has mentioned their ex for the 5th time or whenever you decide that you no longer want to pretend like you don't see them chewing with their mouth open, just activate one of the 3 sensors that the bad date buzzer uses to detect your need for escape. Your Bad Date Buzzer will then trigger your phone to receive a pre-programmed text or call with your cue to leave - over and out!

How is the Bad Date Buzzer Created? 

The Bad Date Buzzer is an Arduino Uno equipped with a Wifi-Shield. It is linked to ThingSpeak, an app channel that we use in our Arduino code in order to access Twilio, a wifi-based text messaging service. The 3 sensors it utilizes to trigger the emergency response are an accelerometer, a photoresistor, and an emergency push button.   The accelerometer responds to hefty shakes to the bag or purse that you put the buzzer in, while the photoresistor will activate the SMS trigger once you open your purse, exposing it to light. And if those sensors are unable to be activated due to poor lighting conditions or inability to shake the purse discreetly, just use the emergency push button to trigger an SMS. 

With the Bad Date Buzzer, you will never be stuck on a bad date again. Go ahead, ask that one guy in your computer science class to coffee even though you're pretty sure he only knows how to tell dad jokes. Just activate the Bad Date Buzzer and you won't need to guess how many lawyers it takes to change in a lightbulb over coffee if you don't want to!
